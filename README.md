# NanoDrugsMalaria

The scripts corresponds to a project between two universities: University of A Coruna (UDC) and 
University of Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. The dataset should be downloaded from an external link provided 
in the *README.txt* from *datasets* folder.

The main idea of the project is to mix Perturbation Theory with Machine Learning and Information Fusion to create models to predict antimalarial activity of Drug-Decorated Nanoparticles. This is very useful for virtual screening. We used 8 classifiers with experimental-centered molecular descriptors and the best model has obtained with Random Forest, 27 selected features and AUC of 0.992.

We just send the results to a journal. After the publication of the results, we will add the link to the paper.

Have fun with ML!
