# NanoDrugsMalaria

The scripts corresponds to a project between two universities: University of A Coruna (UDC) and 
University of Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. The dataset should be downloaded from an external link provided 
in the *README.txt* from *datasets* folder.

We just send the results to a journal. After the publication of the results, we will add the link to the paper.

Have fun with ML!
